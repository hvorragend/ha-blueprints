    # Cover Control Automation (CCA)

    This is a comprehensive and highly configurable blueprint that can be used for the following basic purposes:
    ✅ Automatic opening and closing the roller shutters
    ✅ Freely configurable time windows for opening or closing
    ✅ Brightness control and/or control via the sun-elevation
    ✅ The use of scheduler helpers are possible
    ✅ Ventilation feature (Currently for two-way sensors)
    ✅ Resident feature: keep the cover closed if resident is asleep
    ✅ Complete flexibility in almost all parameters (drive delays, waiting times, position tolerance)
    ✅ Each feature can be activated or deactivated as required
    ✅ Dynamic conditions possible (see examples in `Details`)
    ✅ Extensive automatic sun shading with many different setting options (see features in `Details`)
    ✅ Added the option to save the current status in a helper. This has the advantage that the cover can also be in other positions and the automation can still be executed. And manual interventions are not constantly overridden with every trigger.

    <details>

    **Latest changes**

    2024.02.12-01:
      - Allow input_boolean as contact sensors.
      - The state of the contact sensor can be true/on or false/off
      - Fixed time control bug

    2024.02.13-01:
      - Fixed potential bug when opening via time control

    2024.02.15-01:
      - Fixed timestamp comparison bug
      - Faster checking for manual position changes

    **Condition examples**
    - If, for example, your blinds on the upper floor only close automatically and are not opened via the automation, you can also enable the blinds to be opened during this time by activating a vacation mode boolean.
    - If you have visitors or a party, you may not want the blinds to close. This can be easily configured using a party mode boolean.
    - If, for any reason, you want to pause the activation of shading or the ending of shading, this can be controlled via a shading boolean.
    - If you want to suspend the entire roller blind control for a short time, perhaps because maintenance work or window cleaning is being carried out, this is possible with just one boolean.
    - Are the roller blinds on side doors normally only opened by the automation system and never closed because you don't want to lock yourself out? But on vacation, the blinds should still be closed. This is how the conditions work.

    **Shading features**
    - Sun azimuth
    - Sun elevation
    - Solar irradiation/Light intensity/Illuminance
    - Weather Conditions
    - Two different temperature sensors (compare thresholds for indoor and/or outdoor sensors)
    - Not only the current temperature, but also the temperature forecast can also be taken into account.
    - If multiple criteria (e.g. temperature sensors and/or azimuth and/or elevation) are defined, shading will not occur until <ins>all</ins> criteria are met.

    **Important notes**
    - It is <ins>not</ins> possible to execute this automation manually!
    - If you want to use sun elevation and/or azimuth it's strongly advised to use sun.sun. And please make sure your sun.sun entity is enabled!
    - `time_up_early` should be earlier `than time_up_late`
    - `time_up_early_non_workday` should be earlier than `time_up_late_non_workday`
    - `time_down_early` should be earlier than `time_down_late`
    - `time_down_early_non_workday` should be earlier than `time_down_late_non_workday`
    - `shading_azimuth_start` should be lower than `shading_azimuth_end`
    - `shading_elevation_min` should be lower than `shading_elevation_max`
    - `shading_sun_brightness_start` should be higher than `shading_sun_brightness_end`
    - `open_position` should be higher than `close_position`
    - `open_position` should be higher than `ventilate_position`
    - `close_position` should be lower than `ventilate_position`
    - `shading_position` should be higher than `close_position`
    - `shading_position` should be lower than `open_position`
    - `resident_sensor` is only allowed to be on/off/true/false
    - cover must have a `current_position` attribute
    - After <ins>manual creation</ins> of the helper in the GUI, it will be filled with standard content on the <ins>first trigger</ins>.
      In rare cases, this may mean that the first trigger does not move the blinds. This may take care of itself with the next trigger later.
      Alternatively, the roller blinds must be moved shortly once so that the automation system knows what the current status is.

    *This was originally a fork of Eimeel's blueprint [automatic_blinds_shading.yaml](https://gist.github.com/jmerifjKriwe/bffbc7424dd04f4a31d6a71f7012cd1f) and is largely based on his programming.*
    Note: My blueprint is not compatible with Eimeel's variant. I have used his basis, but the variables are completely different from his design.<br />

        However, you can also activate a scheduler helper mode at this point.
        This would allow you to configure a different time period for keeping the cover open for each day.

        - CHECK THE CURRENT POSITION
        The automation only moves the cover if it is positioned at one of the defined positions (ventilate position, shading position, open position or closed position). Otherwise, the cover has been moved manually.
        After a manual movement, it is unclear what is intended to be achieved, so the automation no longer takes action.
        To automate the movement of the cover again, it must be moved to one of the defined positions beforehand.
        The advantage of this is that you don't have to create a helper in Home Assistant.

        - USE AN EXTERNAL STATUS HELPER
        If you want to be able to intervene manually and the automation should execute the next movement as usual, a helper is required.
        *Without helper, the manual override would always be overwritten by the automation.*
        This has the advantage that the cover does not necessarily have to be in a defined position.
