## ✨ Key Features

### 📍 **Time Control & Scheduling**
- **Flexible Time Input**: Traditional time-based opening/closing with workday/non-workday support
- **Calendar Integration**: Create "Open Cover" / "Close Cover" events in Home Assistant calendars for visual, family-friendly scheduling
- **Hybrid Scheduling**: Combine time-based triggers with calendar integration for maximum flexibility
- **Early/Late Triggers**: Separate early and late times for flexible opening/closing windows
- **Identical Times Support**: Can set early and late times to identical values for guaranteed exact timing

### ☀️ **Advanced Sun Shading / Sun Protection**
- **Flexible AND/OR Logic Builder**: Customize which shading conditions must ALL be met (AND) vs which act as optional boosters (OR)
- **Independent START/END Configuration**: Separate logic for starting and ending shading with dedicated retry timeouts
- **Multi-Condition Support**:
  - ☀️ Sun position (azimuth & elevation)
  - 🔅 Light brightness/illuminance
  - 🌡️ Temperature sensors (indoor/outdoor/forecast)
  - 🌦️ Weather forecasts (daily/hourly/current conditions)
  - 📊 Per-condition on/off switches
- **Hysteresis Support**: Prevents rapid on/off cycling with configurable hysteresis for all temperature-based triggers
- **Unified Retry Logic**: Periodic condition checks with timeout protection for stable behavior

### 📅 **Dynamic Sun Elevation Adaptation**
- **Seasonal Auto-Adjustment**: Optional template sensors automatically adapt elevation thresholds to the season
- **No Manual DST Adjustments**: Covers open/close at consistent solar times year-round
- **Smooth Transitions**: Gradual threshold changes throughout the year

### 🪟 **Ventilation Management**
- **Window State Detection**: Automatically responds to tilted (partial) and fully opened windows
- **Lockout Protection**: Prevents accidental closure during ventilation (prevents residents getting locked in)
- **Flexible Ventilation Positioning**: Optional delay after window closes, support for higher positions
- **Integration with Shading**: Can transition from shading to ventilation when window tilts
- **Race Condition Protection**: Handles multiple simultaneous sensor changes safely

### 🎯 **Cover Type Support**
- **Blinds/Roller Shutters**: Standard logic (0% = closed down, 100% = open up)
- **Awnings/Sunshades**: Inverted logic (0% = retracted, 100% = extended)
- **Automatic Position Logic Adaptation**: Blueprint adapts comparison logic based on cover type
- **Transparent for End Users**: Position values work intuitively for each cover type

### 🖐️ **Manual Override Intelligence**
- **Smart Detection**: Recognizes manual cover adjustments automatically
- **Respects User Decisions**: Honors manual adjustments for configurable timeout period (default 1 hour)
- **Automatic Resume**: Automation resumes after timeout or manual reset
- **Persistent Status Tracking**: Maintains state across Home Assistant restarts via Cover Status Helper

### 🧱 **Tilt Position Control**
- **Multi-Stage Support**: Up to 4 elevation-based tilt positions for optimal shading angles
- **Z-Wave Compatibility**: "Wait Until Idle" mode for devices that block tilt during motor movement
- **Optional Reposition**: Can close blinds before tilting for accurate positioning
- **Flexible Configuration**: Fixed delay or dynamic wait until idle with timeout protection

### 🏠 **Resident Detection & Sleep Schedules**
- **Privacy Protection**: Closes covers when resident goes to sleep
- **Flexible Waking Logic**: Can open covers when resident wakes based on environmental conditions
- **Selective Feature Control**: Choose which features (open/close/shading/ventilation) are allowed per resident

### 🚀 **Force Functions & Emergency Control**
- **Weather Protection**: Force-close for rain, force-open for wind/frost
- **Background State Tracking**: Automatically returns to target position when force is disabled
- **Real-Time Status Updates**: Helper continues tracking target state even during force functions
- **All Position Types**: Return-to-background works for open, close, shading, and ventilation
- **Safeguard Checks**: Only one force function can be active simultaneously

### 🔌 **Flexible Position Source Support**
- **Multiple Position Attributes**: Works with `current_position`, `position`, or custom sensors
- **Alternative Position Tracking**: Use external sensors when cover doesn't report positions
- **Automatic Detection**: Handles missing attributes gracefully

### ⚡ **Performance & Reliability**
- **RF Interference Prevention**: Configurable fixed and random delays to prevent radio interference when controlling multiple covers
- **Race Condition Protection**: Handles multiple simultaneous sensor changes safely (e.g., ventilation + shading triggers)
- **Smart State Tracking**: Helper integration maintains state persistently across Home Assistant restarts

### ✅ **Extensive Configuration Validation**
- **Online Configuration Validator**: Web-based tool to validate YAML before deployment
- **80+ Validation Checks**: Organized into 19 logical sections with clear headers
- **Client-Side Processing**: Privacy-friendly - no data sent to external servers
- **Instant Feedback**: Get actionable error messages and migration guidance
- **In-Blueprint Validation**: Optional basic plausibility check during execution

## 🚀 Quick Start (5 Steps)

1. **Create a Helper**: Set up a text input helper with **minimum 254 characters** (Settings → Devices & Services → Helpers)
2. **Select Your Cover**: Choose the blind or shutter to automate
3. **Enable Features**: Activate the features you need (morning opening? Sun protection? Ventilation mode?)
4. **Configure Basics**: Set opening/closing times and connect your sensors
5. **Test & Refine**: Run the automation and adjust thresholds as needed

---

## 📋 Essential Prerequisites

### Required
- Home Assistant **2024.10.0** or higher
- Text Helper with **minimum 254 characters** (for advanced features)
- Cover entity with `current_position` attribute (or alternative position source)
- `sun.sun` entity enabled for sun-based features

### Important Configuration Rules
- ⏰ **Time ordering**: `time_up_early` < `time_up_late` (and non-workday variants)
- 📍 **Position hierarchy (Blinds)**: `open_position` > `ventilate_position` > `close_position`
- 📍 **Position hierarchy (Awnings)**: `open_position` < `ventilate_position` < `close_position`
- ☀️ **Sun values**: `azimuth_start` < `azimuth_end`, `elevation_min` < `elevation_max`
- 🔅 **Brightness values**: `brightness_start` > `brightness_end`
- 💬 **Resident sensor**: Must be binary (on/off, true/false only)
