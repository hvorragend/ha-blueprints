  - A few logic changes

2024.01.29-03:
  - Added config check for sun attributes
  - Fixed: Wrong trigger condition while closing

2024.01.29-04/2024.01.29-05:
  - Updated descriptions

2024.01.30-01/2024.01.30-02:
  - Fixed and extended config check
  - Fixed closing condition. Wrong fix yesterday. Back to the origin. Will check this later.

2024.02.01-01:
  - Minor Layout changes
  - Removed commented out code
  - Fixed closing-condition
  - Fixed cover status helper initialisation and still make the first cover drive possible

2024.02.02-01:
  - *BREAKING CHANGE:* Please reconfigure/rename the variables close_position and shading_position in your blueprint config.
    Old: closed_position - New: close_position
    Old: shading_cover_position - New: shading_position
  - Added tilt positions for open, close and ventilation

2024.02.03-01:
  - Strict separation of the two brightness sensors. The previous problem was that the shading sensor used the same values to open or close the blinds as the normal sensor. Depending on the sensor (different edge, slope, median, filter, etc.), incorrect triggers occur.
    Important: If required, please register both brightness sensors.

2024.02.03-02:
  - Opening the blinds only until time_down_early. Otherwise, overlaps may occur if the brightness values are not set correctly. Avoid bouncing the blinds.

2024.02.06-01:
  - Added: Helper length validation
  - Comprehensive JSON changes / Now multidimensional JSON
  - Roller blind movements can now only be executed once a day when the helpers are used.

2024.02.07-01:
  - Fixed weather.get_forecasts: The response from the service is a dict with the target entities as keys

2024.02.09-01:
  - Streamline the code
  - Added option to enable time control via external schedule helper
  - Added more options for manual time control (drive up - late on non-workdays / drive down early and late on non-workdays)
  - **Possible breaking change**: You should reconfigure the times in your CCA automations!

2024.02.12-01:
  - Allow input_boolean as contact sensors.
  - The state of the contact sensor can be true/on or false/off
  - Fixed time control bug

  - Fixed: Shading should not be activated when ventilation mode is active
  - Fixed: Closing the door contact should always lower the roller
  - Instead of cover helper and position detection working against each other, the two can now complement each other.
  - Manual detection adjusted. Positions 0% and 100% always result in close/open regardless of the configuration.
  - Forcing a status is now also automatically used as a negative condition in other queries.

2024.03.11-02:
  - Completely new structure of the various choose-branches
  - Relocation of some conditions to the sequence section
  - Redesign of the ventilation mode

2024.05.15-02:
  - Quick workaround, as opening and closing does not currently work.
  - Minor changes

2024.05.22-01:
  - Added: Separation of the contact sensors for ventilation and lockout protection
    BREAKING CHANGE: Reconfiguration of lockout protection necessary!
  - Updated: Combining the shading triggers. No more problems with waiting times and retriggers.
  - Fixed: Do not close after closing the contact if 'Automatic Closing' is disabled
  - Fixed: Missing shading force trigger
  - Fixed: Prevent trigger with invalid status

2024.05.28-01:
  - Complete restructuring and logic change for shading, lockout protection and ventilation:
      - When the cover is opened, the system checks whether a sun shading is already in place. If this is the case, the cover is not opened but moved directly into the shading position.
      - If the cover is to be closed and the contact is open, either lockout protection or ventilation mode is activated.
      - If the cover is closed and the corresponding contact is opened, the ventilation position is activated.
      - When the sun shading is activated, the lockout protection is taken into account if the contact is open. If the contact is closed, the cover moves back to the shading position.
      - When the sun shading is stopped, the lockout protection is checked. It is also possible to move to the ventilation position when the contact is open. If the contact is closed here, the cover is opened.

      <ins>Summary:</ins> CCA saves the temporary status (ventilation, lockout protection and shading) and the actual target status in the Cover Status Helper.
      - This means that the cover is simply opened or closed as before.
      - And it does <ins>not</ins> always return to the previous state (which may have changed in the meantime).
      - Instead, it switches to the state that should actually be current.
  - Fixed: Incorrect position detection during manual drives if shading_position is smaller than close_position
  - Added: Shading activation before opening. The cover can now move into the shading during the opening process. #4
  - Added: Prevent automatic closing due to the resident sensor #63
  - Added: Option to deactivate time control. This means that the system can now also be controlled exclusively via the brightness and the height of the sun. I
  - <strong>BREAKING CHANGES:</strong>
      - Cover Status Helper is now mandatory for ventilation, lockout protection and shading!
      - Invert the status of some options #61 ("Prevent the cover from being ... several times a day" instead of "Allow the cover to be ... several times a day")

2024.06.04-01:
  - Major GUI Update: Using blueprint sections now (Min-Core-Version: 2024.6.0)

2024.06.05-01:
  - Added: Optional checking workday tomorrow sensor when closing the cover #71
  - Updated: GUI section icons to MDI icons

2024.06.24:
  - Breaking change: 'prevent_higher_position_shading_end' changed to new parameter 'prevent_lowering_when_closing_if_shaded'
  - Added: Limited templates for enabling automation triggers
  - Added: Shading sensor 2 is also checked again during shading
  - Fixed: Occasionally sun shading was performed without checking the weather conditions
  - Fixed: The ventilation position was not set correctly when closing the roller blind
  - Fixed: At the end of sun shading, the system no longer moves to the ventilation position
  - Fixed: Sun shading is now also calculated outside the configured times and can be taken into account when opening.
  - Fixed: Option "Prevent the cover from closing immediately after deactivating the lockout protection"
  - Many thanks to Eimeel and Bostil

2024.06.26:
  - <strong>Breaking change:</strong> The option <em>"Prevent the use of the 'get_forecasts' service (prevent_forecast_service)"</em> has been removed and replaced by the configuration option under <em>"Sun Shading Forecast Type"</em>
  - Fixed: If tomorrow is not a working day, the right time is taken now - #80
  - Fixed: If the blind is moved manually below the shading and ventilation position, this is no longer recognised as closed.
  - Added: Additional Actions After Manual Change - #87
  - Added: You can now decide whether you want to use the hourly or daily weather forecast.
  - Added: It is now possible to reset the manual detection of roller blind movements at 00:01 - #86

2024-06-27:
  - Minor bugfix

2024.06.29:

  - Fixed: Faulty timing triggers although they have been deactivated #104
  - Fixed: Removed duplicate line of code without effect #105
  - Fixed: Reset shading status at midnight that is no longer required - but still saved #106

  - Fixed: Helper length analysis template variable warning #120
  - Fixed: New trigger "t_shading_reset" causes errors #119
  - Fixed: "Manual Override" don't work #122 (Thanks to Eimeel)
  - Fixed: Commenting out the check of the position information in the config check #121
  - Fixed: Blinds not opening with resident mode when auto close disabled #115

2024.09.04:
  - Major Update:
      - Complete redesign of the logic behind the contact sensors.
      - Splitting the contact sensors into "Tilted windows" and "Open windows"
      - Lockout protection removed from the automation options
      - Lockout protection can be configured individually
      - <strong>Please reconfigure contacts,  residents and manual override settings!</strong>

  - Major Update:
      - Complete redesign of the shading triggers.
        I have now separated the originally combined triggers again.
        And the waiting time is no longer taken into account in the trigger and also not as a delay in the action sequences.
        Instead, the new trigger time is now saved in the helper.
        This has the wonderful advantage that we can work with several shading triggers again, which do not reset and restart each other.
        Unfortunately, this makes things more complicated in support, as I now need traces for both triggers (pending and execution).
        But I also hope to have fewer customer service calls in the long term.
        In addition, you can now see traces again that were previously not available because they were cancelled directly in the for-wait time.

  - Updated: If you previously used the manual control reset at a certain time, you now have to reconfigure this feature once. I had to rename the variable is_reset_time to is_reset_fixed_time.
  - Added: Config check for schedule helper
  - Added: Sun shading can now be allowed even if a resident is present #131
  - Fixed: A delay is now also taken into account when the sun shading is ended #128
  - Fixed: When checking the end of shading, a True was always output if the weather conditions array was empty #133
  - Fixed: Prevent double triggering if early+late times are identical.

  - Breaking Changes:
      <ins>Removed settings:</ins>
      - "Prevent the cover from closing immediately after deactivating the lockout protection" (prevent_close_after_lockout)
      - "Enable lockout protection" (auto_lockout_protection_enabled)
      - "Contact Sensor Entity For Ventilation" (contact_sensor)
      - "Contact Sensor Entity For Lockout Protectio" (contact_sensor_lockout)
      - "Prevent automatic closing due to the resident sensor" (prevent_closing_by_resident)

      <ins>Please delete the following variables in the YAML code:</ins>
      - prevent_close_after_lockout
      - auto_lockout_protection_enabled
      - contact_sensor
      - contact_sensor_lockout
      - prevent_closing_by_resident
      - is_reset_time (replaces with is_reset_fixed_time)

2024.09.05:

  - Fixed: Small scheduler fix and description also updated
  - Update: Update of the logic and documentation for the resident sensor #158

2025.04.18:
  - Updated: Just to be more bulletproof, the tilt position control can now be specifically switched on or off. Please activate if necessary. #163
  - Updated: There is no default value for "Sun Shading Forecast Temperature" here now. To not compare the forecast temperature, leave this field empty. #179
  - Added: Allow entities of the switch domain as resident sensor or with the force entities #167
  - Added: New additional actions: Commands can now be executed before opening, closing, shading and ventilation #166
  - Fixed: Fixed problems resetting manual override #184
  - Fixed: Make sure that the reset of the manual override is only executed once #178
  - Fixed: Problems with lockout protection and partial ventilation solved #181
  - Fixed: There was no latest time for closing the cover when the scheduler was used with sun/brightness #170
  - Added: Added Sun elevation examples into the description #175
  - Added: New feature 'Allow opening the cover when resident is still present' #192
  - Breaking change: Please reconfigure "Allow sun protection when resident is still present" ('resident_shading_enabled' was renamed)

2025.05.02-01:
  - Fixed: Also take into account for shading that a door contact only needs to be tested when ventilation mode is switched on #197
  - Fixed: Removed protocol error that occurs during manual execution.
  - Added: Catching an incorrect weather configuration
  - Added: Ability to specify an existing sensor if it already provides daily maximum temperature forecast instead of weather entity #199
  - Added: Add hysteresis for temperature sensor based shading #189

2025.05.02-02:
  - Fixed: A bug has been fixed that caused the shading to be recognized but not executed. But only if shading was only allowed to be executed once a day.

2025.05.04:
  - Added: Allow immediate ending of shading if the sun is out of the defined azimuth or elevation range.
  - Added: Option to close cover instead of opening when shading ends (ideal for awnings)
  - Updated: Note that the weather sensor specification is optional #198

2025.05.07:
  - Fixed: Shading is now also recognized and temporarily stored in the helper if the resident sensor contains the value true. #131
  - Added: Tilt Reposition Feature (Thanks for the pull request, Astado) #196
  - Update: Better textual clarification of what the result of the additional condition should look like #204
  - Update: Only shade the cover when it is not in the shading position. Purely as a precautionary measure in case the target state and actual state do not match.

2025.05.11:
  - Fixed: Fixed bug that the cover can be opened again by the time-up-late-trigger despite existing shading.
  - 
2025.05.12:
  - Fixed: Multiple triggering of a detected shading has skipped the waiting time until execution #206

2025.05.13
  - Fixed: The nightly shading reset has changed the timestamp and therefore a new shading with active 'prevent_shading_multiple_times' can never be executed.

2025.05.14
  - Added: Falling below shading_elevation_max now also triggers Shading Start #193
  - Fixed: When detecting manual position changes, values greater than Ventilation were incorrectly assumed to be Open. This was too wide-ranging.

2025.05.20
  - Fixed: Wrong default value for shading_forecast_temp

2025.05.27
  - Updated: Revised information text for configuring the position configuration
  - Added: The schedule helper state has been added as a variable. This is just for debugging purposes. #214
  - Fixed: The problems with the start of shading have been corrected. #212 #211
    If the shading conditions were not still fulfilled after the end of the waiting time, the sun protection was sometimes not activated correctly.
    Now we have a new feature and we can select the following options:
      - If the conditions were not permanently fulfilled, we can wait for another trigger to be executed. The previous pending status is now successfully reset.
      - And much better: CCA can be configured so that we can periodically check the shading during the day. The system then checks again and again until the conditions are valid again.

2025.06.07
  - Added: Resident check for ventilation #216 (Thanks for the pull request, Astado)
  - Added: Better description for shading_forecast_sensor (Thanks you, Eimeel)
  - Fixed: Solve Issue with sun shading end if Tilt Position Control is enabled #216 (Thanks for the pull request, Astado)
  - Fixed: Shades are being opened or closed even if they are already #219
  - Fixed:
    When the “End Sun Shading Immediately When Out Of Range” mode was activated, the shading of the cover was not canceled.
    This was because the new waiting time was set to 0 seconds and CCA could not trigger itself in the same second via a helper.
  - Updated: Extensive code refactoring
  - Updated:
    Automation mode changed to 'single' as a test, because otherwise new triggers in the delay would interfere with processing.
    In the worst case, I will have to work with {{ state_attr('automation.cca_automation', 'current') > 0 }} as before to be able
    to intercept the reciprocal triggers.
